This is a new version of the old website that was auto-generated by HTML5UP. This website however is completely created by myself. So there is no need for a credit section. If anyone is interested in contributing, you are more than welcome to. However, if you are new to GitHub you may not understand all the terms. If this is the case I have provided a tutorial series explaining some of Git. Which can be found at: http://git.tutorials.benjisoft.org.uk. Once again you are more than welcome to leave suggestions in the comment box which will be displayed underneath the tutorials.
