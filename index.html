<!-- The second box explaining the website. -->
<div id="part1">
  This is a website that was made completely from scratch by yours truly! Here you can learn about my journey from websites that looked like: <br> <br>
  <!--The examle website -->
  <iframe src="start.html" width="20%" height="15%" style="border:none"></iframe>
  <br>
  Then I slowly advanced to more advanced websites such as this one. I also previously in school learnt about dreamweaver and the workings of it even though I despise the way I was taught it as we had to use frames. However after this I was working through some worksheets and we started working through "div" elements. Which was when the little burnt out candle inside of my HTML heart was re lit and I decided to start this up.
</div>
<!-- The second part that explains GitHub contribution -->
<div id="part2">
  After the flame had been re-lit, I decided to release all future code onto GitHub. So this code can be found on GitHub at <a href="//github.com/benjisoft/benjisoft-website-new/">https://github.com/benjisoft/benjisoft-website-new/</a>. Where you can contribute to the code if you wish to add anything. If you have never used GitHub before then I have decided at the time of writing this, that I will be creating a series of videos on YouTube that will be availiable on <a href="github-series.html">this link.</a>

<!-- A subtitle for the next topics -->

<!-- Explaining some different projects that I have done over time and where to find them. -->
<div id="part3">
  One of the first projects I ever did as shown above was a simple website as shown above. I then started to move on towards editors (Somewhere I never want to return to) Such as Weebly (Was good has now been ruined by changes to pricing), Wix (Would not recommend, have always hated) and Website Builder (Good for the first month until they change the pricing without notifing you. Also, does not allow change of nameservers with domains registered with them). After this, I started investigating CSS and getting more into the style of websites so they look better than inline styling (Which can become incredibly messy if it is a large website).
  <br>
  After CSS I found a service called Amazon Web Services (Best tool I have ever used!) Although, I have never actualy used it for developing applications as I currently focus my expertise in HTML which I can host on some web hosting that is provided free with my teamspeak server. However, I have decided to try and expand my knowledge into languages such as:
    <li>
      <a href="">
        Android
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      PHP
    </li>
    <li>
      MySQL
    </li>
    <li>
      Javascript
    </li>
  And hopefuly many more. This will enable me to start creating "responsive websites". Or websites that allow Input.

  That is prety much all I have got done so far. If you have any questions for me don't be afraid to email me at: <a href="mailto:benji@benjicraft.info">benji@benjisoft.org.uk</a>.
