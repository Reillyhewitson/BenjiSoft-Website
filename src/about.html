    <b>Skating</b> <br>
    Now before you make assumptions. I am a boy and yes, I do figure skating. Not hockey. In fact, I absolutely despise hockey skaters.<br> I am currently working at Skate UK Level 8. However I go to the John Nike Rink and although SkateUK now only has 8 levels. My rink has stuck with 10.
    <br>Some of the things I have to do before I move on are:
    <table border="1" width:100%>
      <tr>
        <th>Level</th>
        <th>Skill</th>
        <th>And that means?</th>
        <th>Completed?</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>Backwards Outside Continuous Edges</td>
        <td>Going backwards on one foot whilst going around a circle</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>Forward Inside Double Three Turn</td>
        <td>Turning from back to forwards twice on a curve</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>Three Jump</td>
        <td>Turning from forwards to backwards in the air on one foot</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>One foot change of edge</td>
        <td>Changing the side of the foot you lean on at least 3 times in a row along curves</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>Backwards one foot slalom</td>
        <td>Going backwards from side to side on one foot</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>Forward outside three turn back cross excersise</td>
        <td>Start going forwards turn backwards, cross over then step out and repeat</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>Forward inside open mowhawk back cross excersise</td>
        <td>Simlar to above except instead of turning backwards, step inside of your skate in order to go backwards.</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
